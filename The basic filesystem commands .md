# **The basic filesystem commands** <br> 
Below are some examples of how to command file system that I learned in the first week of my class.<br>
```cd``` **Change Directory**
is used to change the current working directory in the terminal.<br>

The ```cd``` command without any argument redirected me to the home directory. Because I was already in the home directory, the command without argument stays in the same working area we already are. The ```cd``` commond with a path to directory as an argument change the working directory to the given path, in my case it changed my working area from ```home``` to ```messages``` . But when I pass the path to file- ```cd en-us.txt``` it returns that its not a directory.
```ls``` **List**
is used to list the contents of the current directory.<br>

```cat``` **Concatenate**
is used to display the contents of a file in the terminal.<br>
